      <p class="first first-after-subhead">Product teams are engineering teams that build a product for external customers. They are noticeably different from platform teams which serve internal customers, and service teams which don’t work on their own products but provide a service for customers or contribute to a product.</p>
      <p class="subsq">On product teams, engineers who tend to make the most impact are what I call product-minded engineers. They are developers with an interest in the product itself; they want to understand why decisions are made, how people use the product, and love being involved in product decisions. They would likely make a good product manager if they ever gave up the joy of engineering. I’ve worked with many great product-minded engineers and consider myself this type of developer. At companies building world-class products, product-minded engineers elevate teams to new levels of impact.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Places where product-minded engineers can make this impact include teams working on user-facing features, or collaborations with product managers. They often become key contributors; the go-to team member for product managers, who frequently advance to be team leads.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Product-minded engineers</span></b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Here are a few traits product-minded engineers share:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Proactive with product ideas and opinions. </b>Do not settle for simply implementing a specification they receive. Instead, they consider alternatives and approach the product manager with them. They often challenge existing specifications by suggesting other approaches that may work better.</li>
        <li><b>Interest in the business, user behavior, and relevant data.</b> Take time to understand how the business works, how the product fits in, and what its goals are. They’re empathetic with how users feel about and use the product. They dive straight into business and user data by accessing it directly if possible, or via the product manager and data scientists.</li>
        <li><b>Curiosity and a keen interest in “why?”</b> Questions like, “why build this feature, but not another one?” are asked by them, and they seek the answer by consulting the product manager and colleagues with this and other product-related questions. They always have questions but manage not to annoy others because they’ve built up strong relationships.</li>
        <li><b>Strong communicators with great relationships with non-engineers.</b> They like talking with colleagues from outside engineering, and learning what people do and why. They are accomplished communicators, with an interest in discovering how other disciplines work. You may see them grabbing coffee, lunch, or having hallway chats with non-engineers.</li>
        <li><b>Offering product/engineering tradeoffs upfront.</b> With a strong understanding of a product’s ”why” and the engineering side of things, product-minded engineers can – and do! – make suggestions few others can.</li>
        <li><b>Pragmatic handling of edge cases</b>. Quickly map out edge cases and think of ways to reduce their workloads, often with solutions that require no engineering work. They’re focused on the ”minimum lovable product concept” and evaluate an edge case’s impact and the effort of handling it. They offer good middle-ground suggestions by mapping what can go wrong and suggesting which edge cases need addressing, even before shipping an early version.</li>
        <li><b>Quick product validation cycles.</b> Before a feature they’re working on is production-ready, product-minded engineers find creative ways to get early feedback. This could be via hallway testing with colleagues, showing a work-in-progress feature to the product manager, organizing a team bug-bash on the beta build, and more. They always ask: ”how can we validate that people will use this feature the way we think they will?”</li>
        <li><b>End-to-end product feature ownership.</b> Most experienced engineers own their work end-to-end, from getting the specification, through implementing it, to rolling it out and validating that it works correctly. Product-minded engineers often go a step further and consider their work “done” only after getting user behavior and business metrics. Post-rollout, they actively engage with product managers, data scientists, and customer support, to learn how the feature is being used in the real world. It can take weeks to get reliable data to draw conclusions.</li>
        <li><b>Strong product instincts through repeated cycles of learning.</b> After each project, their product understanding deepens and they refine their product instincts. Next time, they’ll offer even more relevant input. Over time, they become a go-to person for product managers, with their advice sought well before projects kick-off. They build a strong reputation outside the team, which opens more doors to career growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Becoming</span> a product-minded engineer</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">If you work on a user-facing product, here are a few tips for growing your “product muscle:”</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Understand how and why your company is successful. </b>What’s the business model, how is money made, which areas are most profitable and expanding fastest, and why? Where does your team fit in?</li>
        <li><b>Build a strong relationship with your product manager.</b> Most product managers will jump at the chance to mentor product-minded engineers, as they help managers to scale themselves. They ask the product manager product-related questions, take time to build the relationship, and are clear that they want to be involved in product matters.</li>
        <li><b>Engage in user research, customer support, and related activities.</b> Get involved in activities to learn how the product works. Pair with designers, UX folks, data scientists, operations colleagues, and others who interact with users.</li>
        <li><b>Bring feasible product suggestions to the table.</b> Take the initiative when you have a good understanding of the business, the product, and its stakeholders. You could bring small suggestions to a project you’re working on, or suggest a larger effort by outlining the engineering and product work and making it easy to prioritize in the team’s backlog.</li>
        <li><b>Offer product/engineering tradeoffs for projects.</b> Suggest product tradeoffs that reduce engineering effort, in addition to engineering tradeoffs for the product feature being built. Are open to feedback.</li>
        <li><b>Seek regular feedback from your product manager.</b> Being a product-minded engineer means having good product skills on top of your engineering skillset. The best person to give feedback on this is your product manager, so reach out for feedback on whether your product suggestions are viable, and for their thoughts on growth areas for you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="subhead-2" class="section-title subhead keep-with-next paragraph-follows case-upper">2. PLATFORM TEAMS</h2>
      <p class="first first-after-subhead">Platform teams are the building blocks that product teams use to ship business-facing functionality. Products are built on top of platforms which enable product teams to move faster. Platform teams are key in scaling up high-growth engineering organizations. They share these characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Focused on a technical mission. </b>Concentrate on technical goals like scaling a key area, achieving performance or availability targets, or building architecture that’s easy to extend and maintain, which serves multiple teams and areas.</li>
        <li><b>Customers are usually internal.</b> Most customers of a platform team are engineers on other product teams or, in rare cases, colleagues on the business side who also use the platform.</li>
        <li><b>Used by multiple teams.</b> Each platform typically has multiple customers, products, or other services utilizing its offering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Here are a few examples of a platform team:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The infrastructure team at a scaleup. This team provides compute and storage resources for other teams on in-house platforms, or support teams to use and manage cloud environments.</li>
        <li>A payments platform team at a large tech company. This team offers internal software development kits (SDK) for teams to integrate into their products to enable payments. They interface with payment providers, so other internal teams don’t need to.</li>
        <li>The CI/CD team at most companies. This team owns and manages continuous integration and continuous deployment. They often help drive practices like automated testing approaches, linting, and other approaches to increase the quality of software, and give feedback.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Platform teams tend to be formed when multiple product teams start building solutions for a problem like storage, infrastructure, or for a business capability like payments. In many cases, a dedicated team owns the problem areas, and providing one solution via a platform team avoids duplication while making everyone else’s lives easier.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Platform teams tend to attract some of the most experienced engineers because they often have an engineering mission to build scalable solutions that developers enjoy using. The customers of platform teams are software engineers on other teams, meaning platform teams also attract engineers who want to work with software engineers, not less technical customers.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Upsides of working</span> in a platform team</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Engineering complexity. </b>Platform teams are home to some of the most complex engineering challenges, especially infrastructure platform teams providing storage or compute.</li>
        <li><b>Wide impact.</b> The work of a platform team is not limited to one product; it powers multiple products and has a wide, indirect impact.</li>
        <li><b>More engineering freedom.</b> Many platform teams don’t have product managers, and it feels like engineers run things. This gives freedom to work on tasks like removing technical debt or introducing novel engineering ideas.</li>
        <li><b>Less day-to-day pressure.</b> Being more removed from customers, these teams tend to face less pressure to ship new features or products. This allows for more long-term</li>
        <li>building and avoids having to use hard-to-maintain hacks.</li>
        <li><b>Seniority. </b>Platform teams tend to attract senior-and-above engineers because they benefit from this type of seniority. Engineers who enjoy working with more experienced folks usually enjoy working on these teams.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Downsides</span> of working in a platform team</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The business impact is harder to define.</b> A product team can easily claim its latest feature boosted revenue, or that another feature attracted more users. But platform teams cannot so easily cite metrics the business cares about.</li>
        <li><b>Frequently seen as a cost center.</b> If it’s a struggle to demonstrate impact which the business values, platform teams will more likely be seen as cost centers. This means it will be harder to make a case for headcount and to grow. Relatedly, if a company decides to downsize, these teams may be more affected than profit centers.</li>
        <li><b>More distant from customers.</b> Many platform teams are so far removed from customers that engineers often forget their ultimate task is to make customers’ lives easier. When teams lose touch with customers, it can lead to misplaced incentives and frustration with product teams.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Thriving in a platform</span> team</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Here’s what I’ve observed productive platform engineers do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Build empathy for customers.</b> Most platform teams assume their customers are only software engineers in product teams. But this isn’t true, the other customers are end users whom the product teams serve. Never forget this and build empathy with them.</li>
        <li><b>Talk to engineers using your platforms. </b>Make it easy for engineers who build on top of your platform to communicate with you. Introduce yourself, and invite them to ping you any time with questions. Have easy-to-access email lists and chat rooms where an engineer can ask a question about your platform, and make a point to get back to them, or jump on a call with them. If you don’t build these relationships, you risk becoming an “ivory tower platform engineer” who works on things nobody wants.</li>
        <li><b>Work side by side with platform customers.</b> Most platform engineers build platforms as part of a team. However, standout platform engineers sometimes move to the “other side” and work with a product team on integrating or implementing their platform. Aim to do this when possible, as it gives you a much better appreciation of how teams use your platform. It’s also a lot of fun!</li>
        <li><b>Do a rotation working on a product team.</b> Similarly, rotate and spend a few weeks working on a product team if possible; especially if you’ve not done so for a long time. Product teams use everything you build, so have a connection with them.</li>
        <li><b>Aim for <i>some</i> urgency and focus. </b>A benefit of working on a platform team is that there’s much less urgency to ship things, and there are usually fewer interruptions. This is great because it allows you to do focused, uninterrupted work. On the other hand, the lack of any kind of pressure can make your focus slip from getting important tasks done. Ensure to be clear about what the most important thing you need to do is, and try to make progress and keep focus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Working on both a product and a platform team makes you more well-rounded. A product team and platform team are not superior to each other. An engineer develops a personal preference for one or the other by working on both.</p>
      <p class="subsq">To become a well-rounded engineer, consider working on a new type of team. After working on a product and on a platform team, you’ll understand both better and more deeply appreciate the challenges each faces. And you’ll likely know which one you prefer to work in!</p>
      <h2 id="subhead-3" class="section-title subhead keep-with-next paragraph-follows case-upper">3. “PEACETIME” VS “WARTIME”</h2>
      <p class="first first-after-subhead">When I joined Uber in 2016 the company was doing well, at least that’s how it seemed from the outside after raising $5.6B on a $66B valuation a few months earlier. On the inside, I found things were fast-paced, hectic, and many projects felt like “life or death” matters.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Large parts of Uber operated in “wartime” mode for lengthy periods. This wasn’t a vague feeling, we had terms for it; teams often called for a “war room” meeting to get important projects done, and at the San Francisco HQ, one large meeting room was actually named the “War Room.” Critical initiatives were given “code red” or “code yellow” labels. Conflicts between teams were common because all were focused on moving fast and launching their features.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Uber’s transition to “peacetime” was obvious when it came. In late 2017, Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO and the frantic pace rapidly cooled. Initially, he announced company-wide priorities at the start of 2018, and we ran a more detailed planning cycle. There was a new sense of stability in the air which was absent before.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>So, what are “wartime” and “peacetime” at companies, and how was this term popularized?</b> It was in the early 2010s when Ben Horowitz – cofounder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz – published the article “Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO.” He wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote-container prose without-attribution within-prose-element">
        <blockquote class="prose without-attribution within-prose-element">
        <p class="first blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-first blockquote-position-last">“Recently, Eric Schmidt stepped down as CEO of Google, and founder Larry Page took over. Much of the news coverage focused on Page’s ability to be the “face of Google” as Page is far more shy and introverted than the gregarious and articulate Schmidt. While an interesting issue, this analysis misses the main point. Eric Schmidt was much more than Google’s front man; as Google’s peacetime chief executive he led the greatest technology business expansion of the last ten years. Larry Page, in contrast, seems to have determined that Google is moving into war and he clearly intends to be a wartime CEO. This will be a profound change for Google and the entire high-tech industry.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Here’s how Horowitz defined peacetime and wartime:</p>
      <div class="blockquote-container prose without-attribution within-prose-element">
        <blockquote class="prose without-attribution within-prose-element">
        <p class="first blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-first">“Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company’s strengths.</p>
        <p class="subsq blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-last">In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources, including competition, dramatic macro-economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth. The great wartime CEO Andy Grove marvelously describes the forces that can take a company from peacetime to wartime in his book, “Only The Paranoid Survive.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">The terms “wartime” and “peacetime” became popular in tech and stuck. Basically, companies operate in “wartime” when their existence is at risk, and are in “peacetime” when things are calm and steady.</p>

      <p class="subsq">If your company is operating in wartime mode, how can you thrive? Here are approaches that can work in this context:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting things done: do it quickly with<i> good enough</i> – as opposed to perfect – quality. Speed is usually much more important than quality. Follow the “done is better than perfect” doctrine.</li>
        <li>Handling conflicts: be unafraid of disputes if they help you move faster, but don’t take them personally because they’re usually not personal, but are caused by the wartime context.</li>
        <li>Allies: don’t worry too much about making allies and just focus on getting the work done. If it’s necessary to work with another team to get things done, do so. But there’s no need to build alliances right now, as there’s no time since everyone is heads-down.</li>
        <li>Internal politics: If you have good standing with your manager and skip level, then all’s good.</li>
        <li>Priorities: Work only on things the business needs, right now.</li>
        <li>Job stability: Work like your job depends on it – because it might.</li>
        <li>Pace yourself: Constantly sprinting can end badly, so pace yourself.</li>
        <li>Burnout: This is a big risk. Pay attention to it, and try to avoid it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Thriving in peacetime</span></b></p>
      <p class="subsq">For companies with less stressful environments, other approaches tend to work better:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting things done: Get things done with high quality. Slow and stable beats fast and wobbly in this context.</li>
        <li>Handling conflicts: Avoid disputes, even if they’d help you move faster. Figure out why your conflicts occur because they’re unwelcome in peacetime.</li>
        <li>Allies: Make allies across the teams you work with, as they will help you get things done and may aid your career.</li>
        <li>Internal politics: Important for career advancement, especially in senior positions. Manage upwards, sideways, and down as well.</li>
        <li>Priorities: Work on longer-term initiatives that benefit the business.</li>
        <li>Job stability: Job security exists, with time and space to do things well.</li>
        <li>Pacing yourself: A slow and steady pace can become too slow, so switch up gears sometimes.</li>
        <li>Stagnating: becoming bored at work in peacetime is a risk – so try to avoid this!</li>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Alternating</span> between modes</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Most companies shift between wartime and peacetime modes. For a successful venture-funded startup that eventually IPOs, the pattern is generally this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Founding: wartime. Founders work long hours to build a prototype and hope it clicks with early customers.</li>
        <li>Fundraising: wartime. The team works around the clock to show investors there’s something worth putting money into.</li>
        <li>After fundraising: brief peacetime. With funding secured, the team has breathing space to think long-term: grow the team, build the core idea, and do a few experiments on the side. The earlier the startup stage, the shorter this period is.</li>
        <li>Between fundraising rounds: the same rhythm as above. If funding starts running out or competitors appear, then it’s back to wartime more.</li>
        <li>A year before an IPO: wartime. In the final push to get business metrics where they should be, the company prioritizes areas investors care about.</li>
        <li>After the IPO: it depends. With a successful IPO and the share price rising, it’s hard for the culture to not switch to peacetime. However, if the IPO doesn’t go well and the business struggles, wartime tactics are likely to be used.</li>
        <li>As a public company: more of a pull to operate in peacetime mode at businesses that do well on the market over time. Of course, this depends on leadership.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Companies alternate between wartime and peacetime because they have to, not because they want to. Some leaders would likely prefer to always operate in a high output mode like wartime. But this has several drawbacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Much higher attrition</li>
        <li>Talented people leave due to burnout, who might stay if the stress was lower</li>
        <li>Hard to execute a long-term strategy because priorities are all short-term</li>
        <li>Hard to motivate people to stay in wartime mode if the business is thriving</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">The result of a successful wartime focus is that the company gets ahead in the market and creates enough time and space to recoup. This cycle then repeats.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>The sooner you figure out how to be effective in both modes, the better off you’ll be. </b>Whatever company you’re at, you’ll notice the shift when it happens. Figure out where your team and organization are right now, employ strategies to do well in that context, and assume things will change sooner or later, and that you’ll need to readapt.</p>

        <li>Peacetime vs wartime: these businesses tend to operate in peacetime, as a consequence of enjoying the success which fuelled growth. However, they sometimes switch gears to wartime. Signs this is happening tend to be pretty easy to spot: layoffs, stricter performance reviews, leadership changes, very clear communication from the top about the need to focus, and more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Advice for thriving at large tech companies:</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Keep track of your individual impact. </b>Performance reviews and promotions are usually more heavyweight at these companies. To get fair performance reviews and a promotion, it’s useful to keep track of personal achievements, and the impact your work has at the team and company levels.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Gain allies and a build a network.</b> The benefit of large companies is working with a lot of people! Personal relationships are rarely unimportant in achieving success at work. Help others and gain allies who may later help you get work done better and faster, and could perhaps even assist your professional growth. People tend to come and go at big companies, so those whom you know could help you – or you help them – years later in different workplaces.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Mid or late-stage</span> scaleups</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Scaleups are venture-funded startups that have passed the early stages and are focused on expanding their market. They are businesses in the Series B, C, D, or later stages of funding, but are not yet publicly traded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product vs platform: these companies overwhelmingly have product teams. Platform teams are usually in their very early stages – if they exist at all.</li>
        <li>Peacetime vs wartime: it’s normal for these companies to operate in wartime mode. Talk to people at the company and pay attention to how leadership acts, and you should be able to figure this out quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Advice for thriving in high-growth organizations:</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Tenure is a differentiator. </b>For companies that grow rapidly, it’s common for 50% or more employees to have joined in the past year. At these places, tenured engineers tend to be in demand, as they have a better understanding of how internal systems have evolved than new joiners do.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If you’ve been at a company like this for a few years, there are typically lots of internal transfer options, as most teams welcome knowledge and experience. You’ll also likely find it easier to do well in performance reviews.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Hiring and onboarding is a focus. </b>These companies tend to spend a lot of time hiring, but many put less effort into onboarding. If you’re a more experienced engineer, you can make a large, positive impact just by improving the onboarding experience for new engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Are you in a cost center or a profit center? </b>High-growth companies don’t always care about revenue, and value other growth metrics like the number of active users. Figure out what the company’s main focus is, then get a sense of whether the leadership sees your team as a cost center or a profit center.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>High growth phases end. </b>At some point, high-growth companies stop growing or drop to a lower pace of growth, or realize they’ve over-expanded and make layoffs. During cuts, cost centers are more likely to be affected, along with perceived low performers. This is another reason for working in a profit center.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Early-stage startups</span></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product vs platform: startups rarely if ever have platform teams. Product teams do the majority of work.</li>
        <li>Peacetime vs wartime: at most startups it’s wartime. Much depends on the company’s leadership; some founders create less stressful and more balanced working environments. Others don’t.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Advice for thriving at early-stage startups:</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Figure out how you can help the company achieve product-market-fit. </b>Until a startup gets its product-market fit – meaning there’s customer demand for its offering – the business is at risk of going under due to running out of money.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Your most important job is to help the company succeed by reaching a product-market fit. Talk with the founders, your team, and with customers to figure out how you can help, beyond doing your assigned projects and tasks. Startups are the best places to take the initiative and make a company-wide impact, so do this!</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Know that startups are risky. </b>Among all types of companies, startups are the most likely to let people go, and the most likely to run out of money and go bankrupt.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Take advantage of the autonomy you have. </b>A major upside of working at a startup – which often compensates for some of the risks – is a high level of autonomy for employees. At most startups, doing stuff without getting permission first and then seeking forgiveness later, is an accepted way of working. Hopefully, you have autonomy; if so, take advantage of it!</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Tell the founders about your work. </b>You work at a small company, so it’s fair to assume the founders know about your work, right? In my experience, this isn’t always the case. When you do work that’s impactful, challenging, or both, tell your team and the founders about it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Good work can easily be overlooked amid the hectic pace of startups.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Don’t forget the most important thing about working at a startup: get things done! </b>Everything comes second to this. Ensure you get the <i>right</i> things done – i.e., work that creates value for the startup – and execute quickly!</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b><span class="first-phrase">Approaches</span> to thrive at any type of company</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">There are a few strategies to help you succeed professionally, regardless of which type of company you work at:</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Do standout work. </b>“Standout” work means different things at different companies; some places value quality above speed, while at other places, it’s vice-versa. Figure out what your company values, and aim to over-deliver on expectations of software engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Help others around you. </b>The software industry is small, which is something many engineers don’t realize for years until they unexpectedly bump into former colleagues in different workplaces. Why not forge strong relationships with your peers and help them where possible – even if it’s personally inconvenient? People will hold you in good stead, which can open doors later in your career.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Don’t burn bridges. </b>Try to resolve conflicts that arise, treat others with respect, and learn to disagree agreeably, and professionally. Why? For the same reason as above: tech is a small industry.</p>
