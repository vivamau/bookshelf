There is plenty to learn in order to be able to reliably complete well-defined tasks and smaller projects which call upon your tech skills, expertise, and experience.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Practice, practice, practice” is the single best advice for growth. Beyond building software, things which can speed up your professional growth, include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working in a team where you can learn from fellow developers</li>
        <li>Having access to mentors or buddies to whom you can turn with questions</li>
        <li>Being able to pair with developers</li>
        <li>Having enough time to dive deeply into a technology</li>
        <li>Working on projects and assignments for long enough that you become proficient in the technology, but are able to switch frequently enough in order to keep learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Many developers are in a rush to reach the next rung on the career ladder. This is understandable, as titles carry weight, the promise of better compensation, and superior career opportunities.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, building a solid foundation of knowledge and experience in software development practices; such as learning how to spot when you’re stuck, how to unblock yourself, and acquiring the habit of continuous learning, all take time and will ultimately benefit your career. Time is not ‘wasted’ at junior levels if you keep learning and growing.</p>
