      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">Previously in this book, we discuss “tech lead” being more commonly a role and not an explicit title or career level. So at companies with no tech lead career level, what comes after the senior position? The first level above senior engineer is frequently called “staff engineer” or “principal engineer.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">At Google, after the senior engineer level (L5,) is the staff engineer level (L6,) followed by senior staff (L7,) then principal engineer (L8,) distinguished engineer (L9,) and fellow (L10.) Several Big Tech companies follow a similar approach of senior → staff → principal → distinguished. Uber and Databricks are cases with similar career paths. Netflix and Dropbox also have similar levels, except those companies did not employ a “distinguished engineer” level at time of publication.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, tech companies tend to have slightly different takes on how they think about titles beyond the senior engineer level. For example, Microsoft, Amazon, and Booking.com have no concept of staff engineer; the next career level after senior engineer is ”principal.” And there are companies that use titles like ”architect” (Oracle,) ”principal member of technical staff” (eBay,) or ”lead consultant” (ThoughtWorks,) as the level after the equivalent of senior engineer.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Why do titles vary so much between companies?</b> It’s because expectations vary. It’s worth looking at the title a company uses and asking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the <i>full</i> career ladder at a given company? This gives a better idea of the seniority that certain staff+ titles hold. A good resource for mapping out which career levels companies have beyond the senior engineer level is the website Levels.fyi1. Just be aware it’s harder to compare the scope of two positions than the website may depict, as the devil lies in the details.</li>
        <li>What are the engineering and business impacts of an engineer in a given position? There’s a difference between a staff engineer owning a system generating $1M/year in revenue that’s used by a handful of customers, and another staff engineer owning a system generating $500M/year in revenue, which millions of customers use.</li>
        <li>What is the blast radius of a given position? How many engineers are directly impacted directly, typically? For example, at a smaller company, the blast radius of a principal engineer might be around 10 engineers. In a large workplace like Uber or Google, it could be 100 engineers or more. These two positions are identical in title, but very different in expectations!</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Typical staff+ engineer expectations</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">“Staff+ engineer” is the term I use in this book uses to refer to levels beyond senior engineer, referencing staff, principal-and-above titles.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Staff+ roles vary greatly by title and expectations. Here is my attempt to summarize common expectations across much of Big Tech and larger scaleups. Keep in mind that expectations might be higher than listed for senior positions like principal engineer at companies where principal comes after staff, distinguished, or fellow positions.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Staff+ is a partner of EMs and PMs</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">At most Big Tech and scaleups with a dual-track career ladder for individual contributors and managers, staff engineers are usually on the same career level as engineering managers (EMs,) or senior product managers (PMs.) This is not only symbolic; it also acknowledges staff-and-above engineers are expected to be partners of EMs and PMs. The same is true for more senior staff+ career levels. For example, at Uber the principal engineer level (L7) is the same career level as the director of engineering (also L7.) Also at Uber, principal engineers are expected to be partners to directors of engineering and product. <i>We cover dual-track career paths in Part I: “Career Paths.”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">This expectation is oftentimes unspoken, and it’s down to the staff+ engineer to put in the work and invest in strengthening this partnership. As with any collaboration, the key to making it work is trust; EMs and PMs put in the work to get things done that matter and communicate openly.</p>
