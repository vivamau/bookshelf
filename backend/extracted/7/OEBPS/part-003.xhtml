      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">From this chapter onward, we discuss “software engineering” and not “software development.” For this reason, the title “software engineer” replaces “software developer.” This change is purposeful, even though software development and software engineering are frequently used interchangeably. In my personal usage, software development is a subset of software engineering. Also, software engineering involves thinking about software products across a longer time frame than is the case with software development.</p>
      <h2 id="subhead-1" class="section-title subhead keep-with-next paragraph-follows case-upper">SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT VS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h2>
      <p class="first first-after-subhead"><b>Software development</b> refers to the process of building software, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Outlining a basic plan</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Deploying</li>
        <li>Debugging</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">It’s not uncommon for software developers to be given well-defined tasks, and for their work to be limited to implementing these tasks. At more traditional, non-tech-first companies, the breakdown of work is done by product managers, business analysts, project managers, or architects – but not software developers.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Software engineering</b> is a lot broader than only development. It also involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gathering requirements</li>
        <li>Planning a solution and analyzing tradeoffs between approaches</li>
        <li>Building the software</li>
        <li>Shipping to production</li>
        <li>Maintaining the solution</li>
        <li>Extending the solution to new use cases</li>
        <li>Migrating to other solutions</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq"><b>A software engineer should be invested in the long-term impact of their work, as well as the short-term. </b>Another reason we use the term “software engineer” is to emphasize that at senior-and-above levels, software engineers should consider longer-term impact and not confine themselves solely to the problem at hand, like fixing a persistent bug. Common long-term impacts to think about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to ensure a bug will not recur? One solution could be automated testing.</li>
        <li>How to make sure a similar issue is detected quickly? Monitoring and alerting could be a solution.</li>
        <li>How can the fix be easy to maintain in the future? Options could include readable code, documentation, or coding decisions that make code extensible for future use cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Starting this chapter, we adopt a longer-term mindset when discussing activities and advice. Looking beyond the immediate impact of code written and work done is an important distinction between software developers and software engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In their book, “Software Engineering at Google,” Hyrum Wright, Titus Winters, and Tom Manshreck, argue that software engineering is software development (or programming,) over a much longer time frame:</p>
      <div class="blockquote-container prose without-attribution">
        <blockquote class="prose without-attribution">
        <p class="first blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-first">“We propose that ‘software engineering’ encompasses not just the act of writing code, but all of the tools and processes an organization uses to build and maintain that code over time. What practices can a software organization introduce that will best keep its code valuable over the long term? How can engineers make a codebase more sustainable and the software engineering discipline itself more rigorous? (⋯)</p>
        <p class="subsq blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-last">Software engineering can be thought of as ‘programming integrated over time.’ What practices can we introduce to our code to make it sustainable—able to react to necessary change—over its life cycle, from conception to introduction to maintenance to deprecation?”</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Different senior expectations across tiers of companies</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">In <a class="content-external-link" href="part-001-chapter-001.xhtml">Part I: “Career paths,”</a> we discuss the three tiers of companies, based on compensation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tier 1: bench-marking against the local market</li>
        <li>Tier 2: top of the local market</li>
        <li>Tier 3: top of the regional/international market</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Compensation for senior engineers at Tier 3 companies tends to be several times higher than at Tier 1 employers. This difference in compensation results in Tier 3 companies having higher expectations of their senior engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In this chapter, we cover areas in which Tier 2 and Tier 3 companies hold reasonable expectations of senior engineers.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Typical senior titles</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Titles for software developers vary across companies. Here’s the most common:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Senior software engineer/senior developer: most of Big Tech and many startups/scaleups</li>
        <li>Software engineer: at some companies that dislike revealing levels externally, such as Meta</li>
        <li>Senior Member of Technical Staff (eBay and VMWare), Principal Member of Technical Staff (Oracle)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Title inflation is something that can be particularly observed at lower-tier companies. At Tier 3 employers such as Meta, Google or Uber, it takes two promotions to get to the senior engineer level. At Microsoft, it takes 4 promotions: entry-level engineers begin at L59 (software engineer 1) and the Senior engineer level starts at L63.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, there are plenty of companies where the first promotion from entry-level software engineer is to senior engineer. Consultancies are a case in point; it’s common enough to observe these places describe developers with 2-3 years experience as senior engineers, while engineers with 5-10 years experience at Big Tech can still be at the software engineer 2 level – just below senior.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Of course, title inflation is not confined to the senior engineer level, but this level is the first time that differences in expectations between employers become visible. That titles have different expectations from senior onward in different workplaces, also explains why a “principal” title at an – often lower tier – company, may be equivalent to senior-level expectations at a higher-tier working environment.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Typical senior engineer expectations</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">So, what exactly do tech companies typically expect of senior engineers? Below is a summary. <i>Keep in mind each company is unique, and no two have identical expectations.</i></p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Senior as a terminal level</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">At some companies, the senior engineer level is considered a “terminal level.” This means there is no expectation for engineers to progress further. It also signals that getting promoted to the next level is far rarer and much more challenging, than reaching the senior level is.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Why do many companies decide to make the senior level “terminal?” It’s because senior engineers are expected to be autonomous and to solve complex projects and problems by themselves. Plenty of teams and projects require no more expertise. We cover more on the terminal level concept in <a class="content-external-link" href="part-001-chapter-004.xhtml">Part I: “Promotions.”</a></p>
