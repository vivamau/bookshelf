      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">Software development is a craft that takes years to master. Every engineering leader understands this, as do leaders of tech companies. Better companies put reasonable expectations in place for entry-level software developers and for the levels below senior developer, and senior engineer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Titles for software developers typically vary. The most common ones are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software Engineer (SWE,) SWE 2 (most of Big Tech and many startups/scaleups)</li>
        <li>Developer, Software developer (SDE,) SDE 2 (traditional companies, some startups and some scaleups)</li>
        <li>Member of Technical Staff (MTS.) Some companies founded between the 1970s and 1990s took this title from the iconic Bell Labs, which gave it to senior employees. Businesses using it today include Oracle and OpenAI. OpenAI applies the title “MTS” to all staff, similarly to how other companies use ”software developer” or ”software engineer.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">Almost all companies expect software developers to progress to the senior level. In this section, we cover common expectations for competent developers at most tech companies.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There are plenty of things that most tech companies expect of entry-level and mid-level developers. Below is a set of common expectations. <i>Keep in mind, every company is unique, and no two have identical expectations.</i></p>
