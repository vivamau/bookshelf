      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">The tech industry is fast-moving and most developers tend to change jobs every few years. At the same time, most of us working in tech can expect our careers to last decades. In the article A forty-year career<sup><a id="part-1-uncategorized-endnote-1" class="endnote-source" href="part-001-takeaways.xhtml#part-1-uncategorized-endnote-1-text">1</a></sup>, CTO and author Will Larson reflects on a typical career outside of tech:</p>
      <div class="blockquote-container prose without-attribution">
        <blockquote class="prose without-attribution">
        <p class="first blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-first">“My father retired a few years ago, having worked as a professor at the University of North Carolina Asheville for the significant majority of his adult life. Since then I’ve spent more time than expected reflecting on his retirement and his preceding career. In particular, reflecting on the idea that my career is something I can deliberately develop over a forty-year horizon. Not four IPOs, not fourteen two-year stints, but forty years.</p>
        <p class="subsq blockquote-content blockquote-content-prose blockquote-position-last">It’s strange to realize that I lost sight of the forty-year career model, because for a long time it was the only model I knew. (...) If you have the good fortune to start on the long-term career conveyor belt, do your best to avoid tripping, and ride it to success, home ownership, and eventually retirement.”</p>

      <p class="subsq">Keeping in mind that developer careers normally run for a similar length of time, it’s helpful to map out opportunities you could consider embracing, in the form of different types of companies, and how to navigate performance reviews, promotions, or switching jobs. This chapter presents a variety of approaches for all of the above.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But if you take just one thing from this chapter, make it this:</p>
      <p class="subsq">No one cares about your career as much as you do. Not your managers, and not your coworkers. So figure out how much you care about career progression and put the appropriate amount of work into it.</p>
