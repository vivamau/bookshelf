      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">In the tech lead role you need to balance several things at once:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading a project or an engineering team</li>
        <li>Empowering team members, as well as helping remove blockers</li>
        <li>Keeping in the loop stakeholders, product, and perhaps even your manager</li>
        <li>Being a role model when doing individual contributor (IC) work like coding, code reviews, and being oncall</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq">All this is not easy to balance; it takes time, practice, and some trial and error.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>Lead by example. </b>In the tech lead role, the rest of the team will expect you to lead by example, even if this expectation isn’t explicit. As a tech lead, you should be hands-on enough to take part in planning, writing code, doing code reviews, and joining the oncall rotation if there is one.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Keep in mind that if you take shortcuts like shipping code with no automated tests, or move fast – but regularly breaking production – this will set the tone for the team. If you want to maintain a high quality bar across the team, the best way is to lead by example and produce high-quality work. The same applies to fostering a culture of getting things done and unblocking yourself, or talking to customers and solving their problems.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Also, in the tech lead position, there are additional responsibilities which means less time to do IC work. So when you can do IC work, make it count. Let your output set a high quality bar for getting things done on your team.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b>The best tech leads don’t think they are superior to other engineers. </b>One reason why many companies don’t use the title “tech lead” is that the word “lead” denotes a leader of followers. But the most productive teams I’ve worked in all had in common that everyone felt they had a valid say, and job titles didn’t get in the way of suggesting how to do things better, faster, or with higher quality.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As a tech lead, strike a balance between taking the lead when needed, and creating an environment where all engineers have a voice and the confidence to take the initiative and make decisions. Don’t forget your goal as tech lead is not to “lead,” with people always turning to you and following your decisions. The goal is to help the team and project to succeed, and for people to work as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq">A team in which people are more independent will almost always be more efficient than one where everyone waits for the tech lead to decide.</p>
