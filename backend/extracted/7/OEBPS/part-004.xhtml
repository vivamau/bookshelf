      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">The tech lead position is a particularly interesting one because being a tech lead is more frequently a role than a formal title.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Being a tech lead implies you’re an experienced, usually senior-or-above engineer. You are also the lead on a project, or the go-to person in your engineering team during all projects. There are teams with multiple tech leads; one for each initiative, and others with only one tech lead, who’s usually the most experienced, or longest-tenured engineer on the team.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Typical tech lead titles</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">At companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Uber, there’s no title called “tech lead.” After the senior engineer level is the staff engineer level. But at these companies, there is frequently a tech lead role within a team or project. In contrast, some companies do have a formal tech lead position.</p>
      <p class="subsq">At companies where the tech lead is a formal title, the most common titles for this position are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tech lead</li>
        <li>Lead engineer / lead developer</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Typical tech lead expectations</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Expectations of tech leads are usually similar to those of senior engineers, with the addition of leading projects. At some companies, tech lead expectations are closer to those of a staff engineer. See the introductions of <a class="content-external-link" href="part-003.xhtml">Part III</a> (Senior) and <a class="content-external-link" href="part-005.xhtml">Part V</a> (Staff) for common expectations of those levels.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Additionally, expectations of a tech lead can overlap with those of an engineering manager. Tech leads are not responsible for managing people, but they tend to take on the management responsibility of helping people to better align. This is an area engineering managers typically own, until they have tech leads to delegate it to:</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width"><b>Where the IC and manager paths diverge</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">A high-performing tech lead who is usually a prime candidate for an internal engineering manager promotion, or transition. At the same time, tech leads often have the opportunity to stay on the individual contributor path, and grow into staff+ positions.</p>
      <p class="subsq">At fast-growing companies that need to hire several engineering managers, it’s common for tech leads to have the option to move into a manager position. The manager role is different to the software engineer one, and this transition is outside the scope of this book. For advice on navigating the transition into manager, here are books I recommend:</p>
