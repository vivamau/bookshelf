      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">The terms “staff engineer,” “principal engineer,” and other staff+ engineer titles can mean surprisingly different things at different companies. There will be places where a principal engineer title is what is considered a senior engineer role elsewhere, and also companies where a staff engineer role has a blast radius of around 50-100 engineers – which is well above normal. So instead of just focusing on the title, figure out what the expectations are at your current workplace, and at businesses you want to join.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Staff+ engineers are frequently partners with EMs and PMs, and tend to work across several teams. It’s often an unspoken expectation that they uncover new problems worth solving, as well as fixing existing ones.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Balancing your time by dealing with context switches tends to become more of a challenge. Here’s a visualization of how time spent changes for a software engineer, a senior engineer, and a staff engineer:</p>

        <p class="inline-image-caption"><i>How time spent changes, as engineers progress into more senior positions. Staff engineers tend to have less dedicated time for activities directly related to building software.</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">At this level, understanding the business is table-stakes, together with working well with a wide range of people, such as EMs, PMs, business folks, and other engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">At this level, you’ll be expected to lead by example in building reliable and resilient software systems, utilizing industry practices, and putting ones in place that help your group execute better.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Even if you don’t hold the title ”software architect,” you’ll certainly play this role. Don’t forget that doing so is not only an opportunity to make pragmatic long-term decisions, but also to get team members involved, and mentor and teach them to become better at long-term thinking.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The best thing about staff+ roles is how much of a positive impact you can have on the products you build, the group you are part of, and the engineers you work with. Keep learning, keep getting things done, and don’t forget to meaningfully help other engineers by mentoring and sponsoring them, as well. And of course, enjoy the ride!</p>
      <p class="subsq">Writing is a skill that becomes increasingly important for staff+ engineers. This skill is especially in-demand when working within large organizations, when working remote, or working with distributed teams. While we did not go into detail on this topic in the book, you can read more in the online, bonus chapter for Part V:</p>
