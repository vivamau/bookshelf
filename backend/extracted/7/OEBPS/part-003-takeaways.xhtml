      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">To be a role model senior engineer, it’s necessary to master the craft of software engineering, but this alone isn’t enough. In fact, at the senior level, coding-related activities are the less challenging work; collaborating efficiently with others, and helping the team get stuff done, is much more difficult.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It is at the senior level where the impact of your work is more important than the effort you put into it. For that reason, finding smart ways to work can yield large dividends.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Separately, mentoring somebody is an underrated way to help them become a more efficient engineer, and it also helps you grow as a professional. Similarly, seeking mentorship from more experienced engineers can broaden your outlook, and help you get increasingly</p>
      <p class="subsq">complex work done.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The term “senior engineer” is often a bit vague across the industry. There are places at which it is a mid-level engineering role (usually lower tier companies, as we covered in <a class="content-external-link" href="part-001-chapter-001.xhtml">Part I: “Career Paths”</a>,) but in some businesses, it refers to something like the tech lead level. Meanwhile, other companies have expectations that are more common for staff and principal engineers.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However broad or narrow the definition of ‘senior’ is, it’s a reasonable expectation that a relatively complex project will be accomplished when a senior engineer is involved. If issues come up, it is the senior engineer who finds ways to unblock things. And if they get stuck, they flag this, ask for help, and bring options to the table.</p>
