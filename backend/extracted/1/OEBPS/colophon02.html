  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>The birds on the cover of <em>Beyond Vibe Coding</em> are wallcreepers (<em>Tichodroma muraria</em>), a species native to inland cliffs and mountain peaks across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. In flight, wallcreepers are said to look like large butterflies, but they are difficult to spot at rest against rock faces. The wings have rich red coloring with black and white feather tips, while the bodies are mostly blue-gray. Breeding males have black necks.</p>

  <p>Adult wallcreepers are about 6 inches long and weigh about 0.6 ounces. They raise a single brood each year, laying clutches of three to five eggs in cup nests of moss and grasses wedged into rock crevices. They are insectivores. </p>

  <p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the wallcreeper’s conservation status as “Least Concern.” Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.</p>
